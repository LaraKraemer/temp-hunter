# Scraping temperature data 
I am currently learning Python. This is a project from my udemy bootcamp 
where I scrape temperature data. The focus of the lectures was on learning scraping from data, storing of data and 
visualizing of data. 

## How to work with this repository
1. Clone the repository
2. Make sure you have the latest Python version. I worked with 3.12.
3. Open Project: `cd myproject`
4. Install venv: `python3 -m venv venv`
5. Run venv: `source venv/bin/activate`
6. Write more code, write the tests, and have fun! ðŸŽ‰
